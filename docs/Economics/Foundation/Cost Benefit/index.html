                    <p>Cost-benefit thinking is a fundamental approach to understanding the world through the lens of trade-offs. For every choice you make, there is the <span class="highlight">utility</span> (satisfaction or joy) you gain from that choice, and the <span class="highlight">opportunity cost</span> of the thing you didn't choose. This framework recognizes that economics is fundamentally about individuals making choices under conditions of scarcity.</p>

                        <p><strong>College Decision:</strong> Choosing to attend college provides utility through education and future earning potential, but the opportunity cost includes the salary you could have earned working instead, plus tuition costs.</p>

                    <p>Opportunity cost is the value of the next best alternative that you give up when making a choice. It represents what you sacrifice to get what you want.

                    <p>Sunk costs and opportunity costs represent the same fundamental idea approached from different angles. <span class="highlight">Opportunity cost</span> asks you to compare the consequences of your current choice with the next best alternative available to you. Crucially, neither consideration should factor in the time or resources you have already invested in a choice (sunk costs), but should focus solely on comparing the best path forward versus your current choice. The key insight is that past investments are irrelevant to future decision-making.</p>
