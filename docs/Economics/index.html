<h2>1. Opportunity Cost</h2>
<p>Opportunity cost refers to the value of the next best alternative that is forgone when making a decision. For example, if you choose to spend time studying instead of working a part-time job, the opportunity cost is the income you could have earned during that time.</p>

<h2>2. Thinking in Margins</h2>
<p>Thinking in margins means considering the additional benefits of an action versus the additional costs. For instance, when deciding whether to produce one more unit of a product, a company evaluates if the revenue from that unit exceeds the cost of producing it.</p>

<h2>3. Marginal Cost</h2>
<p>Marginal cost is the cost of producing one additional unit of a good or service. For example, if a factory produces 100 cars at a cost of $1,000,000 and the cost to produce one more car is $10,000, the marginal cost of that car is $10,000.</p>

<h2>4. Market Equilibrium</h2>
<p>Market equilibrium occurs when the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded at a certain price level. For example, if a new smartphone is priced at $500, and consumers are willing to buy exactly 100,000 units at that price, the market is in equilibrium.</p>

<h2>5. Sunk Cost</h2>
<p>Sunk cost refers to money that has already been spent and cannot be recovered. For example, if a company has spent $1 million on a project that is failing, that amount is a sunk cost; the company should not let it influence future investment decisions.</p>
